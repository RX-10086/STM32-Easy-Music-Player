# STM32-Easy-Music-Player
Simple Music Player Based on STM32, Button and Passive Buzzer. Coding with C and assembly language.
This experiment is the final project of the course "Principles and Design of Intelligent Embedded Systems". The experiment is titled "Simple Music Player Based on STM32, Button and Passive Buzzer". Through studying the course "Principles and Design of Intelligent Embedded Systems" and the relevant manual of STM32F407, we attempted on-board development.
Considering the practical design requirements of different functions, the programming process of this experimental project uses a mixture of C language and assembly language. C language focuses on the implementation of functions, while assembly language focuses on the GPIO interface of the STM32F407 chip and related accessories.
Due to some force majeure factors, we did not use the experiment box, instead, we used our own STM32F407 development board, button and passive buzzer.
